<h1>🚀 EngineEx</h1>
EngineEx is a smart diagnostic interface that helps users input engine-related parameters, check for issues, and receive intelligent suggestions or possible faults in real-time.

<h1>🧩 Problem Statement</h1>
Modern engines are complex, and identifying faults manually often requires deep technical knowledge or costly diagnostic tools. Many vehicle owners and technicians struggle with:

Understanding engine parameters and symptoms

Quickly diagnosing common engine problems

Making informed decisions without expert help

This gap delays repairs, increases costs, and often results in poor engine health due to misdiagnosis or neglect.

<h1>❗ Why This Problem Exists</h1>
Lack of Accessible Tools: Diagnostic tools are often expensive, proprietary, or require training.

Fragmented Information: Data about engine symptoms and possible faults is scattered across forums, manuals, and mechanics' knowledge.

Limited Predictive Insight: Users rely on reactive checks rather than predictive analytics to maintain engine health.

No Simple UI: Most solutions lack a user-friendly interface for non-experts to input symptoms and understand outcomes.

<h1>✅ Our Solution</h1>
EngineEx addresses these issues through an integrated web interface powered by the MERN stack and intelligent backend logic:

<h1>🛠️ Features</h1>
Simple Engine Form: Users can input engine parameters, symptoms, or error codes.

Condition Checking: Backend evaluates input against a diagnostic ruleset or ML model.

Suggestion System: If no match is found, the system suggests the closest possible issues.

Data Logging: All inputs are securely stored in MongoDB Atlas for future learning or analytics.

Interactive Results Page: Clear visual feedback is provided with possible causes and next steps.
